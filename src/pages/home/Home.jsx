        As a recent Economics graduate with a robust analytical foundation, I am
        eager to transition into the dynamic realm of Software Development.
        Currently on the brink of completing an intensive Frontend Development
        bootcamp, I have specialized in JavaScript and gained hands-on
        experience with technologies such as React, jQuery, APIs, and Git
        Version Control. Motivated by a constant pursuit of knowledge, my goal
        is to forge a successful career in software development while expanding
        my coding repertoire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education has played a pivotal role in shaping my skills. I graduated
        with an Upper Second Class Honors in BA Economics from Nottingham Trent
        University. Prior to this, at Alton College, I achieved AAA in Business,
        Economics, and Law A Levels. My academic journey commenced at Eggar's
        School, where I secured two A's and eight B's at the GCSE level.

        {" "}
        My technical proficiency extends beyond theoretical understanding. The
        bootcamp not only equipped me with a deep understanding of JavaScript
        and React but also honed my ability to write, debug, and test code for
        examination and review. I excel in applying theoretical programming
        concepts, such as State and Interactivity in React, to real-world group
        projects. Effective communication is another forte. In academic
        settings, I successfully collaborated in small groups under time
        constraints, delivering impactful presentations on current economic
        issues. This proficiency extends into software development, where I have
        demonstrated strong presentation skills within an agile methodology. My
        team and I developed a Whatâ€™s Near You web application, incorporating an
        interactive Map API and a cocktail selection website, meeting consumer
        criteria effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Beyond technical skills, my interpersonal strengths shine. I possess
        strong communication and presentation abilities, evident in both
        academic and software development environments. In addition, I am an
        enthusiastic and driven individual with a keen desire to cultivate
        professional relationships and further my career. This drive is
        reflected in my dedication to part-time work, continuous learning
        through the bootcamp, and a willingness to pursue professional
        qualifications alongside my role responsibilities. In essence, I am an
        ambitious and capable individual poised to contribute actively to the
        dynamic landscape of software development. I am not only equipped with
        technical skills but also possess the interpersonal and analytical
        skills necessary for success in collaborative and innovative
        environments.
